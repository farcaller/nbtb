# The No-Bullshit Tulpa Book

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/farcaller/nbtb.svg)](https://gitter.im/farcaller/nbtb?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

This short book is targeted for people, interested in the tulpa phenomenon. It explains what a tulpa is in a straightforward and verifiable way. You can use it to understand better what the hype is about and if it's suited for you. The book teaches you how to learn from your personal experience; thus, it's called "The No-Bullshit Tulpa Book". I will not ask you to believe some random bullshit; I will only suggest you some practical exercises. This book might be controversial to other guides you've seen. This book requires some serious time investments if you decide to follow it.
