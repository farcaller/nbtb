This short book is targeted for people, interested in the tulpa phenomenon. It explains what a tulpa is in a straightforward and verifiable way. You can use it to understand better what the hype is about and if it's suited for you. The book teaches you how to learn from your personal experience; thus, it's called "The No-Bullshit Tulpa Book". I will not ask you to believe some random bullshit; I will only suggest you some practical exercises. This book might be controversial to other guides you've seen. This book requires some serious time investments if you decide to follow it.

This is a work of fiction. I bear no responsibility about your mind based on what you will do with yourself after reading this book.

## Copying and sharing this work

The license above governs the process of using this work. As a personal appeal, I would highly recommend to use the link to gitbook instead of copying the text, as it will evolve further and your copy might get stale. This also applies to translations, gitbook supports them natively, so if you want to translate NBTB, get in touch and we will figure out the best way to do it.
